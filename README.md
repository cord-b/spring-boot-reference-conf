A `reference.conf` HOCON file with defaults based on Spring Boot's existing defaults.

This is mostly for:
* Testing compatibility with using [Typesafe Config](https://github.com/lightbend/config) as a property loader.
* A quick reference for editing application configuration.

Warnings:
* This is NOT guaranteed to be correct, up-to-date, or a replacement to official documentation. Always refer to the official Spring Boot documentation when configuring your projects.
